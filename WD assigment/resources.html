        <h2>Mindset</h2>
        <h4 style="color: #ff0000;">The Most Important Aspect of Learning to Code</h4>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Going to class should be one of your priorities, many people think they know everything and they end up failing, 
            going to class is one of the most important things. Showing up is a good habit.
        </p>
    
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            The key to becoming a successful programmer is building strong <strong>problem-solving skills</strong>. 
            You’ll gain these skills by working on projects, facing challenges, and learning from your mistakes.
        </p>
    
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            A common pitfall for beginners is falling into <strong>Tutorial Hell</strong>, relying too much on tutorials 
            without trying to write your own code. Tutorials are helpful, but the real growth comes from experimenting, 
            failing, and figuring things out on your own.
        </p>
    
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Keep this mindset in mind as you learn:
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Practice daily:</strong> Even 20 minutes a day can make a big difference.</li>
                <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Work on simple, achievable projects like a to-do list app.</li>
                <li><strong>Explore new challenges:</strong> Build websites, games, or try technologies like machine learning.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
