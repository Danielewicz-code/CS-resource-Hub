CS Resource Hub - Web Development Assignment - Jozef T. Danielewicz

1. Purpose
-----------
This website is created as part of a web development assignment. The theme of the website is "CS Resource Hub" 
designed to provide helpful resources and guidance for Computer Science students, particularly beginners.

2. Structure
------------
The website consists of the following four interconnected pages:
   - index.html: The home page introduces the website and its purpose.
   - resources.html: This page lists tools, steps to get started with Python, and links to learning platforms.
   - career_pathways.html: This page provides information about various career options in Computer Science, including skills needed, average salaries, and resources.
   - contact.html: This page features a feedback form to collect user input.

3. Implementation
------------------
The website fulfills all the specified requirements:
   - At least 4 connected pages: All pages are linked through navigation buttons.
   - At least 3 hyperlinks: External links to learning platforms like GeeksforGeeks, FreeCodeCamp, etc. (I put a lot of these)
   - At least 3 images: Includes images on the home, resources, and career pathways pages.
   - Button navigation: Buttons are used in the navigation bar.
   - Unordered list: Displayed on the resources page under tools.
   - Ordered list: Included on the resources page for Python learning steps.
   - Table: A career pathways table is provided with columns for career paths, skills, salaries, and resources.
   - Form: The contact page features a form with text, email input, textarea, and a submit button.
   - CSS:
       - External CSS: styles.css for global styling.
       - Internal CSS: <style> features included when needed on some pages, mostly on contact.html where I used the most.
       - Inline CSS: Directly applied to individual elements like images or paragraphs mostly.

4. Testing
-----------
The website is compatible with both Firefox and Chrome. All pages, links, and interactive elements have been tested for functionality.

5. Notes
--------
- I did used artificial inteligence and youtube to make this website, mostly for CSS which was the most tedious thing for me due to its format, 
    html structure took me some hours but I'm happy with the result. 
- The code was done in VS Code using the extention "Live server" that helped me keep track of how it looked.
- Salaries in the career pathways table are approximate averages and may vary by location, experience, and demand.
- Resource links provide guidance for beginners to explore tools and career paths further.

6. File Information
-------------------
- index.html: Main page file.
- resources.html: Learning resources page.
- career_pathways.html: Career pathways page.
- contact.html: Contact form page.
